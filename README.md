This project demos how to send messages from one webapp to another using camel in VM queues.

It was written to check if this process would work in a unit tests.  Using VM queues requires camel-core jar to be on the system classpath.  I was unsure if a junit would affect this, because "something" was going wrong with unit tests in a more complex code base.

Also, this demos in some way how to do camel messaging in java.  So keeping it stashed here.
